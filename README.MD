A RESTful API for streaming audio into Discord voice channels.

The purpose is to enhance the atmosphere of TTRPG games played over Discord using sound effects, background tracks, and ambient music. While existing music bots can fulfil this role, their interfaces are limited by the constraints of chat commands in Discord text channels.

Exposing an API enables the development of richer client interfaces.
